      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Voty is a decentralized voting protocol based on DID, that aims to offer
        a fair and user-friendly governance system for all types of communities.
        Unlike token-based voting systems, Voty has proposed the idea of
        <nobr>"<b>DID-based Governance</b>"</nobr>, which enables communities to
        obtain valuable opinions from all members, instead of concentrating
        power among a select few.

      <h2>Defects in current voting systems</h2>
      <h3>1. Token-based</h3>
      <p>
        All commonly-used voting systems on the market are token-based, meaning
        that a user's right to vote and the weight it carries are determined by
        the amount of tokens the user holds. This leads to two major issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inability to benefit organizations and communities who haven't issued
          tokens;
        </li>
        <li>
          Powers can be easily transferred as voting rights are based on tokens.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><img src="/0.png" alt="" loading="eager" decoding="async" /></p>
      <p>
        It's evident that the number of communities that have issued tokens is
        significantly lower than those that haven't. Issuing tokens in the early
        stages of a community can be a burden rather than an advantage. These
        communities will face challenges such as: token distribution, token
        pricing, liquidity, and preventing speculations from disrupting the
        community's dynamics and relationships. We can conclude that there will
        be a large number of communities that will run well without tokens, but
        these communities will undoubtedly have governance needs, and existing
        voting systems will not be able to meet this demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether the tokens are fungible or non-fungible, they can easily be
        traded on the market. Using them as voting rights means that the voting
        rights can also be easily traded, and that leads to potential corruption
        and speculation. In most cases, those with the most influence in the
        community are not the ones who contribute the most. Instead, they are
        often speculators, the wealthy in the real world, or a small number of
        project founders who have managed to obtain more tokens. If someone who
        does not have tokens wants to steer the community in the right
        direction, they must first purchase tokens from these individuals, which
        will expose them to the risk of token value fluctuations and severely
        limit the development of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not saying that governance based on token is completely
        unfeasible. In fact, those communities that aim for financial returns
        are often token-based. However, we believe that most communities, or a
        community most of the time, are not able to be and do not need to be
        governed based on token.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Allows for nonprofessional involvement</h3>
      <p>
        In any community there is a division of work based on specialization.
        For example, a group of engineers might come together to provide
        technical support for the community, a group of marketers might
        contribute their knowledge and time to the community's marketing
        efforts, and a group of language majors might offer multilingual support
        for the community. In the real world, decisions about which technology a
        product should adopt are typically made based on the opinions of
        engineers alone. Similarly, decisions about where the community should
        increase its marketing investment are based on the opinions of
        marketers. However, in the current voting system, any member who holds
        voting rights (which are token-based and easily obtained) can
        participate in all proposals by voting, even if they don't fully
        understand the meaning of the proposal. This can result in a situation
        where nonprofessionals make decisions about how professionals should
        work.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Low voter turnout</h3>
      <p>
        Voter turnout is a crucial indicator that all communities concern, as it
        represents the extent to which a proposal takes into account the voices
        of the community. Low voter turnout arises from a lack of motivation.
        When communities attempt to provide incentives to encourage their
        members to vote, the existing voting systems fall short, mainly in the
        following ways: administrators cannot offer members incentives through
        the voting systems after they have voted, and the voting systems do not
        provide a comprehensive report of member participation.
      </p>
      <h2>Voty's advantage</h2>
      <p>
        Voty is a cutting-edge voting system. It far surpasses other existing
        voting systems on the market in many aspects.
      </p>
      <h3>1. DID based</h3>
      <p>
        There's no doubt that using SubDID of .bit (or a SubDomain of ENS) as a
        system for recognizing community identity is an unavoidable trend.
        Whether it's a DAO, a brand, a celebrity, or any type of community, they
        can bring their members/fans together by distributing SubDID, creating a
        highly recognizable community. Using the Nike community as an example (a
        hypothetical case), possession of alice.nike.bit is direct evidence of
        Alice's membership in the Nike community. By owning alice.nike.bit,
        Alice has the right to participate in governance and express her
        opinions within the community, even if she doesn't hold any tokens from
        the community (or in other words, there's no need for the community to
        issue any tokens) When setting up Voty, community administrators can
        assign a .bit account to represent the community, such as nike.bit. This
        will allow only users who possess a xxx.nike.bit account to be
        recognized as members of the community and participate in governance by
        creating proposals or casting votes.Community administrators can specify
        a .bit account associated with the community when initializing Voty, for
        example: nike.bit. By doing this, only users who own xxx.nike.bit are
        considered as community members, and allowed to initiate proposals or
        vote on proposals within the community.
      </p>
      <h3>2. "Workgroup" structure design</h3>
      <p><img src="/1.png" alt="" loading="eager" decoding="async" /></p>
      <p>
        In Voty, a community is composed of one to many WorkGroups.
        Administrators can set different purposes, voting rules, eligible
        proposal initiators, and eligible voters for each WorkGroup. This design
        enables effective governance in large communities by allowing different
        WorkGroups within the community to handle different divisions of work.
        They can make independent decisions and operate without interference
        from one another. A member may be part of multiple WorkGroups, just as a
        person may hold multiple positions in the real world.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Flexible "Member Set" functionality and weight distribution</h3>
      <p>
        Each WorkGroup has three crucial components: rules, proposers, and
        voters. To handle different scenarios, the concept of "Member Set" was
        proposed. Simply put, Member Set is a list of members who meet certain
        specified criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each WorkGroup has a set of "Proposers" and a set of "Voters." The
        "Proposers" set is composed of one or more Member Sets, while the
        "Voters" set is composed of one or more Member Sets, along with the
        weights of votes that are tied to each Member Set. The filtering
        criteria for each Member Set in a WorkGroup can be configured by
        administrators. This enables them to determine who can propose and who
        can vote in that WorkGroup. The criteria can be diverse and may include
        a whitelist, holding a specific SubDID or SBT, holding a SubDID
        associated with a particular NFT/Token, or custom code, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        For "Voters", administrators can assign weightings to each Member Set
        when it's created, and the weighting assigned applies to all members in
        the Member Set. Community members can also delegate their voting rights
        to other members.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Blockchain Agnostic</h3>
      <p>
        Voty is designed to be blockchain-agnostic for the following two
        reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Not only crypto communities or those communities on a certain
          blockchain require a decentralized voting system
        </li>
        <li>
          The governance method in Voty is based on DIDs, represented by .bit,
          which can be controlled by any private key of an asymmetric
          cryptography algorithm. This makes Voty capable of serving a wider
          range of communities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5. Community engagement dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        Voty provides a community engagement dashboard module for each
        community, which displays the frequency of proposals, the average voter
        turnout, and a list of active members, among other things. This data
        provides valuable insights that can be used to improve community
        development.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Open-source, no permission needed</h3>
      <p>
        Voty should technically be referred to as the Voty Protocol as it
        outlines the basic structure and expansion options of this decentralized
        system. voty.xyz is an implementation of the Voty Protocol, serving as a
        complete and usable product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the Voty protocol and voty.xyz are open-source and require no
        permission, enabling anyone to develop their own implementation of the
        Voty Protocol instead of using voty.xyz. Additionally, anyone can
        participate in the development of the Voty Protocol through VIP (Voty
        Implementation Possibilities).
      </p>
      <h3>7. Permanent</h3>
      <p>
        All data on voty.xyz is stored on Arweave. According to Arweave's
        statement, this allows for the permanent recording of a community's
        governance process, enabling us to review and understand the evolution
        and development of the community at any given time.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Transparent and unalterable</h3>
      <p>
        The Voty Protocol has achieved the seemingly obvious but yet
        unaccomplished goal of being entirely transparent and unalterable
        through the use of blockchain technology. "Transparent" in Voty means
        that all rules, proposals, and each vote are publicly displayed. Any
        changes are traceable, and votes can not be maliciously undercounted.
        "Unalterable" in Voty means that all rules, proposals, and votes contain
        cryptographic signatures are stored on the blockchain. As a result, any
        fraudulent data can be easily identified and excluded.
